## Current Status
We've successfully implemented:

2. **AI Quote Generation**: Implementing AI-assisted quote creation
3. **Working Demo**: Creating a testable demo of the application

## Technical Requirements for Next Session
- We'll need to explore OpenAI Whisper API integration for voice recognition
- We may need to set up a development environment for testing the mobile app
- We'll continue using the GitHub repository with the token for version control

## Where to Find Things
- **Design Assets**: In the `design-system` branch
- **UI Mockups**: In the `mobile-app/assets` directory
- **Integration Code**: In the `messaging-integration/src` directory
- **Documentation**: In the `documentation` branch

This summary provides continuity for our next session where we'll focus on implementing the voice input functionality using OpenAI Whisper and creating a testable demo of the application.

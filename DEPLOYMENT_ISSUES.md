# Website Deployment Issues - fieldquote.ai

## Overview
This document details the issues identified when comparing the demo site (https://iibmfpxi.manus.space/) with the production site (https://fieldquote.ai/). These issues need to be addressed to ensure the production site matches the quality and functionality of the demo site.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Missing/Broken Images
- **Logo**: The FieldQuote logo is broken or not loading properly on the production site
- **App Screenshot**: The app screenshot in the hero section is not displaying
- **Feature Icons**: Icons for features (microphone, lightbulb, chart) are missing
- **Footer Badge**: The "Made with Manus" badge is missing from the footer

### 2. Styling Issues
- **CSS Loading**: CSS styling appears to be partially broken or not fully loaded
- **Color Scheme**: Inconsistent color scheme throughout the site
- **Button Styling**: Buttons have different styling between demo and production
- **Layout**: Spacing and alignment issues throughout the page

### 3. Functionality Concerns
- While the basic structure and content are present, the professional appearance is compromised
- The site looks incomplete and unprofessional compared to the demo

## Potential Causes
1. **Incorrect File Paths**: Image and asset paths may be incorrectly configured
2. **CSS Files**: CSS files may not be properly uploaded or linked
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Required resources or dependencies may be missing
4. **Server Configuration**: Potential issues with server configuration or permissions

## Next Steps
1. Verify all files were correctly uploaded to the Namecheap hosting
2. Check file paths in HTML for images and CSS references
3. Ensure all assets (images, CSS, JS) are in the correct directories
4. Validate server configuration and permissions
5. Test fixes in a staging environment before redeploying to production

## Priority
This issue should be considered **HIGH PRIORITY** as it affects the professional appearance and functionality of the public-facing website.

## Timeline
These issues should be addressed in the next development session before continuing with UI/UX improvements.

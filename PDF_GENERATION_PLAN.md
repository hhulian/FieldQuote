### 3. Integration Points
The PDF generation will be integrated at these points:
- After quote generation is complete

- Available as a share option

### 4. User Flow
1. User creates quote using voice input and AI generation
2. User reviews the generated quote
3. User taps "Generate PDF" button
4. App displays PDF preview
5. User can customize PDF options (if desired)
6. User confirms and generates final PDF
7. PDF is saved locally and/or shared via messaging
